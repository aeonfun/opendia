## 🚀 What is OpenDia?

OpenDia lets AI models control your browser automatically. **The key advantage? It leverages everything you already have**—your logged-in accounts, saved passwords, cookies, wallets, and browsing history. No need to start from scratch or switch contexts.

**🔑 Use Your Existing Digital Life:**
- ✅ **Logged-in accounts**: Post to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook with your existing sessions
- ✅ **Browser data**: Access your bookmarks, history, and saved passwords
- ✅ **Extensions & wallets**: Use MetaMask, password managers, or any installed extensions
- ✅ **Cookies & sessions**: Stay authenticated across all your favorite sites
- ✅ **Local testing**: Perfect for development with Cursor - test with real user sessions

**✨ Key Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Universal AI Support**: Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor and even local models
- 🎯 **Anti-Detection**: Specialized bypasses for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook
- 📱 **Smart Automation**: AI understands your pages and finds the right elements
- 🛡️ **Privacy-First**: Everything runs locally, your data stays with you
- ⚡ **Zero Setup**: Get started with one command

## 🌐 Browser Support

Works with **Chrome, Firefox, and any Chromium-based browser**:
- ✅ **Google Chrome**
- ✅ **Arc**
- ✅ **Mozilla Firefox**
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge**
- ✅ **Brave**
- ✅ **Opera**
- ✅ **Any Chromium based browser**

Also perfect for **Cursor users** who want to automate their local testing and development workflows!

## 🔌 Compatible AI Clients

OpenDia exposes a standard MCP server, so it works with any client that speaks the protocol.

**Tested:**
- **Claude Desktop** — paste the config below, restart.
- **Claude Code** — same MCP config, runs from any terminal.
- **Cursor** — add via Settings → MCP, or paste the same JSON.
- **ChatGPT** — works with Auto-Tunnel mode (`npx opendia --tunnel`), then add the ngrok URL as a connector.

**Should work** (any MCP-compatible client): Windsurf, Zed, Continue, Cline, Goose, Open WebUI.

Wired it up with something else? Open a PR — the list grows as MCP grows.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Browser Extension

**For Chrome/Chromium browsers:**
1. Download `opendia-chrome-1.1.0.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/aeonfun/opendia/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or your browser's extension page)
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder

**For Firefox:**
1. Download `opendia-firefox-1.1.0.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/aeonfun/opendia/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the extracted folder

> **Note**: Firefox extensions are loaded as temporary add-ons and will be removed when Firefox restarts. This is a Firefox limitation for unsigned extensions.

### 2. Connect to Your AI

**Option 1: Double-click Installation (Recommended)**
1. Download the `opendia.dxt` file from [releases](https://github.com/aeonfun/opendia/releases)
2. Double-click the `.dxt` file to install automatically
3. The MCP will be added to your Claude Desktop configuration

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opendia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["opendia"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor or other AI tools**, use the same configuration or follow their specific setup instructions.

## Usage Modes

### Local Mode (Default)
```bash
npx opendia
```
- Chrome extension: ws://localhost:5555 (auto-discovery enabled)
- Claude Desktop: stdio (existing config)
- Local SSE: http://localhost:5556/sse

### Port Configuration
```bash
# Use custom ports
npx opendia --port=6000              # Uses 6000 (WebSocket) + 6001 (HTTP)
npx opendia --ws-port=5555 --http-port=5556  # Specify individually

# Handle port conflicts  
# Note: Existing OpenDia processes are automatically terminated on startup
```

### Auto-Tunnel Mode
```bash
npx opendia --tunnel
```
- Automatically creates ngrok tunnel
- Copy URL for ChatGPT/online AI services
- Local functionality preserved

Because the tunnel is public, `/sse` requires a bearer token in this mode. The
server prints one at startup; pass `--token=<value>` to pin a fixed one across
restarts. Send it with every request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://<tunnel>.ngrok-free.app/sse
```

### Network Binding
Both listeners bind `127.0.0.1` by default, and `ngrok` connects from this machine,
so the tunnel works without widening anything. To expose the HTTP/SSE port on the
LAN deliberately:

```bash
npx opendia --http-host=0.0.0.0      # requires a token, same as --tunnel
```

The WebSocket extension channel always stays on loopback.

**Note**: For auto-tunneling to work, you need ngrok installed:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ngrok
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install ngrok

# Or download from https://ngrok.com/download
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok

# Or download from https://ngrok.com/download
```

Then get your free authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken and run:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

    A[AI Model] --> B[OpenDia Server]
    B --> C[Browser Extension]
    C --> D[Your Browser]
    D --> E[Any Website]
```

1. **You ask** your AI to do something browser-related
2. **AI calls** OpenDia tools to understand and interact with pages
3. **OpenDia controls** your browser through the extension
4. **You get results** - AI can see what happened and respond intelligently

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your data stays private**:
- ✅ **Everything runs locally** - No cloud processing of your browsing data
- ✅ **You control access** - Extension only works when you want it to
- ✅ **Open source** - Full transparency of what the code does
- ✅ **No tracking** - We don't collect or store any of your information

**Important**: This tool requires broad browser permissions to function. Only use with AI models you trust, and in environments where you're comfortable with browser automation.
