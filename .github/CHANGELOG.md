# Changelog

Notable changes to the OpenDia MCP server and browser extension.

Release notes on the [Releases page](https://github.com/aeonfun/opendia/releases)
are written from this file, so land your entry in **Unreleased** with the change
itself rather than reconstructing it at tag time.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Grok Build harness + plugin.** Marketplace index at `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json` (and Claude-compatible `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), plugin package under `plugins/opendia/` with `.mcp.json`, skills (`opendia`, `opendia-harness`), and harness docs. README lists Grok Build under Compatible AI Clients with plugin and `config.toml` setup.

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **`--tunnel` now requires a bearer token.** Publishing the MCP server through a
  tunnel used to mean anyone who learned the URL could drive your browser. `/sse`
  is now authenticated whenever the surface leaves this machine (`--tunnel`, or
  `--http-host=` set to a non-loopback address). The server generates a token at
  startup and prints it; pin a fixed one with `--token=<value>`.

  Existing tunnel users **must** add the header — an online AI connector that
  worked before will start returning `401` until it does:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

  Purely local setups (`npx opendia`, Claude Desktop over stdio, the browser
  extension) are unaffected and need no token. (#55)

- **The `prompts/*` workflow surface is gone.** `prompts/list`, `prompts/get` and
  the six workflow prompts (`post_to_social`, `post_selected_quote`,
  `research_workflow`, `analyze_browsing_session`, `organize_tabs`, `fill_form`)
  have been removed. They were unreachable in practice: the server never declared
  a `prompts` capability during `initialize`, and `prompts/get` replied with
  `{ content: [...] }` where the spec requires `{ messages: [...] }`, so
  spec-compliant clients never called them. Tools are unaffected.

### Security

- **`--token=` with an empty value disabled authentication entirely.** The flag was
  matched with `startsWith('--token=')`, so a bare `--token=` produced an empty
  token, and the request guard treated an empty token as "no auth configured" and
  waved every request through. The startup banner was gated the same way, so
  nothing was printed — `--tunnel --token=` published an unauthenticated
  browser-control endpoint with no visible sign, defeating the boundary added in
  #55. `--http-host=` had the same bug and bound all interfaces. Empty flag values
  are now a startup error, and invalid `--port` values fail with a readable message
  instead of an unhandled rejection.

- Bind the extension control channel to loopback and gate its handshake. The
  WebSocket server listened on all interfaces, and because the connection handler
  hands the extension slot to whoever connects last, any reachable peer could evict
  the real extension, receive every automation command, and return fabricated
  results to the model. (#53)
- Bind the HTTP/SSE surface to loopback and refuse page origins. `POST /sse` passes
  its body to the MCP request handler, so the same control was reachable from the
  LAN and — via `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — cross-origin from any website you
  visited. Both listeners now bind `127.0.0.1`, every request carrying a page
  `Origin` is rejected, and CORS is reflected only for allowed origins. (#55)
- Override `adm-zip` to `^0.6.0`, clearing GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85 (crafted ZIP triggers
  a 4GB allocation). Dev-only and not reachable from `web-ext lint`; the override
  exists because `firefox-profile` pins `~0.5.x` and cannot reach the patch. It is a
  stopgap — removal is tracked in #58. (#56)
- Bump `node-forge` to 1.4.0 and `brace-expansion` to 1.1.15. (#43)

### Fixed

- **Tools no longer report failures to the model as success.** `get_history`
  rendered a browser API failure as "No history items found", `get_selected_text`
  rendered four distinct failures as "No text selected", `page_navigate` claimed
  success when its wait condition had timed out, and the research workflow claimed
  it had bookmarked a page after the bookmark call failed. Each now surfaces the
  real error. The genuine empty cases still report normally.
- **A dropped connection no longer executes tools anyway.** The extension's
  connection helper resolved without waiting for the socket to open and swallowed
  connection failures, so a tool call proceeded even when the server was
  unreachable — `tab_close` and `element_click` ran against the browser while the
  reply was written to a socket that was still connecting and discarded. The model
  saw only a generic "Tool call timeout" and would reasonably retry a side effect.
  Connections now resolve on open and fail loudly, and Chrome reuses a live socket
  instead of replacing the one the request arrived on.

### Removed

- The enhanced-pattern matching tier in the content script. It had never executed:
  its guard referenced an identifier declared nowhere in the codebase, so it threw
  on every call and the failure was swallowed, silently degrading `page_analyze` to
  a viewport scan. The legacy single-phase analysis engine went with it — reaching
  it required a `phase` value that both tool schemas forbid. `page_analyze` output
  is unchanged, because none of the removed code could run.

### Maintenance

- Dependency bumps: `ws` (#52), `web-ext` (#48), `actions/checkout` 4 → 7 (#46),
  `actions/setup-node` 4 → 7 (#47, #51).
- Consolidate community docs under `.github/` and add SECURITY + CONTRIBUTING (#44),
  move `LICENSE` back to the repo root so GitHub detects it (#45), update
  attribution to aeonfun / Aeon Inc (#49), aeon-style README (#50).
